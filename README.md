# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game
 Classic Tic-Tac-Toe in Python using Pygame.
 To download it, make sure to download (fork) the GameAssets directory as well. Without it, the main.exe (the game) will throw error. Run the python file only if you   have pygame installed. There's no requirement of pygame if you are running the .exe file but make sure about the GameAssets because you'll need need it in either     
 cases.
 Glad to hear your feedbacks...
